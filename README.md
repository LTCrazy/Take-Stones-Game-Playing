# Take-Stones-Game-Playing
A mini game with Alpha-Beta search

Implement the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to play a two-player game called Take-Stones. 


Input: java Player <#stones> <#taken_stones> <list_of_taken_stones> <depth> 

For example, with input: java Player 7 2 3 6 0, you have 7 stones while 2 stones, numbered 3
and 6, have already been taken, so it is the Max playerâ€™s turn (because 2 stones have been taken), and
it should search to end game states.
